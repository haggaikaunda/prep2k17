Q2: util.py
see function upsamle in line 5. 

For the purposes of this question, 'upsampling'
will mean repeating every element of a list n
times. 

For example
>> mylist = [1, 2, 3]
>> upsample(mylist, 2)	  <- n is 2
>> [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3]     <- you shoud see this.


Q3: util.py
see function extend_code in line 19. 

In this question, we want to repeat a list n
times. 

For example:
>> mylist = [1, 2, 3]
>> extend_code(mylist, 2)
>> [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]


Q4: util.py
see function multiply_lists in line 32

Given two lists A and B of the same length, return a new
list C such that C[i] = A[i] * B[i]

Example:
>> A, B = [1, 2], [3, 4]
>> C = multiply_lists(A, B)
>> C
>> [3, 8]

Q5: util.py
see function add_lists in line 43

given two lists A and B of the same length, return a new 
list C such that C[i] = A[i] + B[i]

Note that if A or B is empty we return the none empty list 
or an empty list if both are empty.
